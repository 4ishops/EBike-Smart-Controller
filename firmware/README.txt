EBike Smart Controller (OpenSource) -- let's make it

Do you want to join the efforts to develop an OpenSource EBike Smart Controller?
Please join the efforts if you value such EBike Smart Controller.

My idea: created an OpenSource EBike Smart Controller for bicycles with Smart capabilities and hackable/configurable options for advanced users. It will communicate wireless (Bluetooth) with Smartphones.

My idea of an EBike Smart Controller:
- Available kilometers for traveling: indication of the energy available in the battery and estimation of available Kms for traveling. The controller monitors the voltage and current used from the battery and also monitors the rotation of the motor/wheel.
- Cruise control: possibility of cruise control but with constant control of speed(automatic control of current) and not constant power as current market controllers.
- Maximum power/current: possibility to configure the maximum power/current used by the motor.
- Ramp acceleration: possibility to control the ramp of acceleration.
- Battery protection: low voltage battery protection configurable value (LVC) and maximum current.
- Wireless communications with SmarPhones: using wireless (Bluetooth) for output and input of data: speed, current, voltage, power, efficiency and on the fly configuration of maximum current and battery LVC -- this information can be seen/controlled on Android and other SmartPhones.
- High voltage and current: scalable for high voltage and current.
